      title: "Agile Software Development"
      number: "INH.04062UF"

        Successful organization of software development projects with special consideration of knowledge management aspects. The course emphasises agile methods, in particular extreme programming, and their relation to informal techniques in requirements analysis, design, implementation and validation of software.

        The focus of the exercise part is placed on the software development methodology for mobile Android applications, e.g., the technical quality regarding the testability and maintainability of the software. The practical work takes place in teams of 5-8 students, whereas no devices can be made available by the university, and therefore participants need to bring their own hardware.

        This course covers modern techniques and methods in the software development process. In particular, established techniques are presented that help students in a practical way to overcome the complexity of software development. The course emphasises agile methods, in particular extreme programming, and their relation to informal techniques in requirements analysis, design, implementation, and validation of software.

        The focus of the exercise part is placed on the software development methodology for mobile Android applications, e.g., the technical quality regarding the testability and maintainability of the software.
